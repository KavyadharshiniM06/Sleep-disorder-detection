# Sleep Disorder Prediction 

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict sleep disorders based on health and lifestyle factors. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

##  Insights & Observations

### Why Sleep Duration Has Lower Feature Importance?

Although *Sleep Duration* is intuitively expected to play a major role in determining sleep disorders, its feature importance was relatively lower compared to other variables like stress levels, occupation, or BMI. This could be due to:

- **Multicollinearity**: Other features such as physical activity level or stress may already capture the effects of sleep duration.
- **Data Distribution**: The range or variance in the recorded sleep durations might be limited in this dataset.
- **Model Dependency**: Tree-based models can sometimes deprioritize features that don’t provide clear splits in the data.

Therefore, while sleep duration is important in a general health context, its predictive power in this specific dataset and model setting was found to be less dominant.
